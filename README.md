## Overview

This is a basic Social Profile challenge. My main focus was on creating fluid padding with the clamp function, and ensuring that users could navigate the links using only the keyboard.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

I started from the Figma files, setting up CSS custom properties from the design system. I then set up my basic CSS environment, removing default browser spacing and began with the HTML. I then worked from the top of the HTML down, adding the appropriate styling. Finally, I added fluid spacing where appropriate to make the design responsive.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Clamp function
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I am honing my workflow efficiency and ability in the fundamentals, ensuring that these core skills become second nature.

I am also becoming much more confident with clamp and calc functions to create fluid, responsive designs without unnecessary media queries.
